NOTE : - QUESTION IS FOR ONLY UNDERSTAND WHAT IS PROBLEM AND WHAT TO DO ?

QUESTION:--Write a query identifying the type of each record in the TRIANGLES table using its three side lengths. Output one of the following statements for each record in the table:

Equilateral: It's a triangle with  3 sides of equal length.
Isosceles: It's a triangle with  2 sides of equal length.
Scalene: It's a triangle with  3 sides of differing lengths.
Not A Triangle: The given values of A, B, and C don't form a triangle.
Input Format

The TRIANGLES table is described as follows:



Each row in the table denotes the lengths of each of a triangle's three sides.

Sample Input



Sample Output

Isosceles
Equilateral
Scalene
Not A Triangle



ANSWER:--         SELECT CASE 
            WHEN a <= 0 OR b <= 0 OR c <= 0 THEN 'Not A Triangle' 
            WHEN a + b <= c OR a + c <= b OR b + c <= a THEN 'Not A Triangle'
            WHEN a = b AND b = c THEN 'Equilateral'
            WHEN a = b OR b = c OR a = c THEN 'Isosceles'
            ELSE 'Scalene'
        END AS triangle_type
FROM triangles;
